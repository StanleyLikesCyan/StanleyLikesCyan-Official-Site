## About Me
My name is Stanley Piper, most commonly known as StanleyLikesCyan. You may have found this site 
because of my YouTube channel, or my music. Anyhow, you've come to the right place.

By around the age of 8, I began to have a fascination with film making and I'd
always create these stupid little iMovies with me and my friends. It was only
until late 2017 when I discovered the wonderful world of YouTube and started my
very first YouTube channel which we now know today. It wasn't the most popular 
channel on YouTube back then (still isn't) however, I thoroughly enjoyed 
uploading crappy videos and was constantly checking if I received any comments.

During this time I started experimenting with HTML, Ableton, Unity, and all 
matter of crazy things. This led to the website you're seeing now, my SoundCloud 
and the games company I founded, Loud Games! (TM).

I then got better at video editing and started recording gaming commentaries that 
were mostly around Minecraft. After this I started my very first music tutorial: 
"How to Make Vaporwave" and soon that video would hit over 2000 views.

Nowadays, I record a series known as "Minecraft Under Quarantine" where I play 
Minecraft in these somewhat troubled times.
